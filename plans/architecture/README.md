# Architecture Documentation

**Status**: In Development  
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-25

## 📐 Architecture Overview

This directory contains architectural decisions, design patterns, and technical specifications for the AI-Powered Enterprise Multi-Agent Swarm Platform.

## 🏗️ Current Architecture State

### Completed Foundation
- ✅ **Multi-Provider Architecture** - Intelligent Claude CLI routing system
- ✅ **Database Schema** - PostgreSQL with tenant isolation and provider management
- ✅ **API Framework** - FastAPI with WebSocket support and JWT authentication
- ✅ **Plugin System Foundation** - Extensible plugin architecture framework

### In Development
- 🔄 **AI Workflow Synthesizer** - Claude-powered intelligent workflow generation
- 🔄 **Human-Loop Intelligence** - Automated decision making for human intervention
- 🔄 **Swarm Coordination** - Multi-agent orchestration and communication

## 📋 Architecture Documents (Coming Soon)

### Design Patterns
- **design-patterns.md** - Established patterns and their applications
- **provider-patterns.md** - Multi-provider integration patterns
- **plugin-patterns.md** - Plugin development and integration patterns

### API Design
- **api-design.md** - RESTful API design principles and standards
- **websocket-design.md** - Real-time communication patterns
- **integration-patterns.md** - External system integration approaches

## 🎯 Architecture Principles

### SOLID Compliance
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Open-Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Evolutionary Architecture
- **Fitness Functions**: Automated architecture quality gates
- **Incremental Changes**: Small, reversible architectural decisions
- **Continuous Assessment**: Regular architecture health checks
- **Experimentation**: A/B testing for architectural choices

## 🔍 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

*ADRs will be added here to track important architectural decisions and their rationale.*
