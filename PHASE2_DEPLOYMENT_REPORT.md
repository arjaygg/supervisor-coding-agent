- Resource Requirements: Very high CPU/memory, 10K tokens
- Dependencies: Authentication, authorization, multi-team coordination
- Confidence: 90%

### Resource Management
```
✅ Resource Types: 7 types available
✅ Allocation Strategies: 7 strategies implemented

✅ Dynamic Monitoring: Real-time metrics collection
```

## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### Security Middleware Configuration
**Issue:** Health endpoints blocked by security validation  
**Error:** `400 Bad Request - Invalid header content detected`  
**Resolution:** Added health endpoint exemptions to security middleware  
**Commit:** `c6e3190` - Security middleware fix  

**Affected Endpoints:**
- ✅ `/api/v1/ping` - Now working (returns `{"status":"ok","message":"pong"}`)
- ✅ `/api/v1/healthz` - Now accessible
- ✅ `/api/v1/health/detailed` - Now accessible

### TaskType Enum Compatibility
**Issue:** `PROCESSING` TaskType not available  
**Resolution:** Used valid `FEATURE` TaskType for testing  
**Available Types:** 10 task types validated (PR_REVIEW, CODE_ANALYSIS, etc.)
