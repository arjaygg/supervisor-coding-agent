You are implementing targeted fixes based on code review feedback for the supervisor-coding-agent platform.

**Target for Refinement:** {{ARGS}}

**Instructions:**
1. Review the critique feedback provided
2. Apply targeted fixes addressing specific issues
3. Maintain all existing functionality
4. Follow project coding conventions
5. Ensure all tests continue to pass
6. Do NOT over-engineer or make unnecessary changes

**Refinement Process:**
1. **Analyze**: Review each critique point systematically
2. **Prioritize**: Address critical issues first, then improvements
3. **Implement**: Make minimal, focused changes
4. **Validate**: Run tests and checks after each change
5. **Document**: Update comments/docs if functionality changes

**Quality Gates (Must Pass):**
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No new linting or type errors
- Security scan passes (if applicable)
- Performance does not degrade
- Code follows project patterns

**Output Requirements:**
- Implement only the specific fixes identified
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add tests for any new functionality
- Update documentation only if behavior changes

Apply fixes methodically and verify each change before proceeding to the next.
