## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Required Setup
- [ ] Set `GCP_PROJECT_ID` in GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] Verify `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` is configured
- [ ] Verify `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` has required permissions
- [ ] Enable required Google Cloud APIs:
  - [ ] Cloud Run API
  - [ ] Secret Manager API
  - [ ] Artifact Registry API
  - [ ] Cloud Build API

### Secret Manager Setup
- [ ] Run `deployment/secrets/setup-secret-manager.sh`
- [ ] Update placeholder secrets with actual values:
  - [ ] OpenAI API key
  - [ ] GitHub token
  - [ ] Let's Encrypt email
  - [ ] Database credentials (if using Cloud SQL)

### Permissions Verification
- [ ] Service account has `secretmanager.secretAccessor` role
- [ ] Service account has `run.developer` role
- [ ] Service account has `artifactregistry.writer` role

## Deployment Testing

### Test Commands
```bash
# 1. Test in PR comment:
/deploy-cloud-run development

# 2. Monitor deployment in GitHub Actions
# 3. Verify services are accessible:
curl $API_URL/api/v1/ping
curl $FRONTEND_URL/health
```

### Expected Results
- [ ] Build completes in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Both services deploy successfully
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Services are publicly accessible
- [ ] Auto-scaling works (scale to zero after idle)

## Cost Monitoring

### Expected Savings
- **Before**: $12-15/month (VM-based)
- **After**: $2-8/month (Cloud Run)
- **Savings**: 60-80% reduction

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Enable billing alerts in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Monitor Cloud Run usage in first week
- [ ] Compare costs with previous VM deployment

## Performance Validation

### Cold Start Testing
- [ ] Measure cold start time (expected: 2-3 seconds)
- [ ] Test auto-scaling under load
- [ ] Verify service performance meets requirements

### Build Performance
- [ ] Parallel builds complete successfully
- [ ] Build cache effectiveness verified
- [ ] Total deployment time < 3 minutes

## Rollback Validation

### Automatic Rollback
- [ ] Test Cloud Run revision rollback
- [ ] Verify traffic splitting works
- [ ] Validate emergency rollback procedure

### Fallback to VM
- [ ] Keep VM deployment available during transition
- [ ] Document fallback procedure
- [ ] Test VM deployment as backup

## Security Validation

### Secret Management
- [ ] Secrets are fetched at runtime (not build-time)
- [ ] All secret access is logged and auditable
- [ ] No secrets present in container images
- [ ] IAM permissions follow principle of least privilege

### Container Security
- [ ] Containers run as non-root user
- [ ] No SSH access required for deployment
- [ ] VPC connector configured (if needed)
- [ ] Network security policies in place

## Documentation Validation

### User Guides
- [ ] Migration guide is complete and accurate
- [ ] New deployment commands are documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide is available
- [ ] Team has been trained on new workflow

### Operational Docs
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting procedures
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Cost optimization guidelines
- [ ] Security best practices

## Final Sign-off

### Development Team
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Testing completed successfully
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved

### Operations Team
- [ ] Deployment procedures validated
- [ ] Monitoring setup completed
- [ ] Security review passed

### Management
- [ ] Cost benefits validated
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
- [ ] Migration approved for production

## Post-Migration Tasks

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor performance and costs daily
- [ ] Address any issues immediately
- [ ] Collect team feedback

### Week 2-4
- [ ] Fine-tune auto-scaling settings
- [ ] Optimize resource allocation
- [ ] Plan VM decommissioning

### Month 2
